# Homework-Manager-App

A homework tracking application. Intended for more practice with Data Structures in C++.

ðŸ“’ This will be a CLI App to be used by students to manage/track their assignments for their classes.

NOTE: Targeted for Windows devices at the moment. Not guaranteed to work on Apple or Linux OS.

To uninstall you only need to delete the "C:/Program Files (x86)/homework" folder and the "C:/Users/user/homework" folder. I will attempt to include an uninstall functionality later. 
P.S. If the "C:/Users/user/homework" folder doesn't exist, then that means you haven't run the homework app yet and therefore have no app data to delete. You can ignore the second folder in this case.

# Dependencies:
 - C++17 or later (for filesystem library)
 - Nlohmann's JSON API (found in include)
